The .pkl files in this directory may be opened in python using cPickle,
pickle, or pylearn2.serial.load.

train.pkl, and test.pkl each contain a pylearn2 Dataset object defining a
labeled dataset of a 32x32 contrast normalized, approximately whitened version
of the CIFAR-10 dataset. train.pkl contains labeled train examples. test.pkl
contains labeled test examples.

preprocessor.pkl contains a pylearn2 ZCA object that was used to approximately
whiten the images. You may want to use this object later to preprocess other
images.

They were created with the pylearn2 script make_cifar10_gcn_whitened.py.

All other files in this directory, including this README, were created by the
same script and are necessary for the other files to function correctly.
